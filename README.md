allows attaching the PyDev debugger to a running Maya instance.

> [!NOTE]
> For those looking for the compiled version, you can find it in the **[JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/31239-mayarecharm/)** or install it directly from your IDE's plugin manager.

> [!TIP]
> If you need older versions, you can find them in the original [MayaCharm repository](https://github.com/cmcpasserby/MayaCharm) by Chris Cunningham.

## Installation

MayaReCharm requires some minimal setup. The settings panel is located at `Settings | Other Settings | MayaReCharm`.

Use the ➕ button to add a Maya Sdk.
MayaReCharm autodetect `mayapy` executables if they're installed at their default location.
Otherwise, you can set a custom path in `Interpreter path`.

![MayaReCharm Settings Panel](docs/MayaReCharm3_Settings.png)

> [!WARNING]
> Adding `mayapy` via the standard `Settings | Python Interpreter` is not supported.

### Edit Maya Sdks

You can edit Maya options using the ✏️ button.

![MayaReCharm Settings Panel](docs/MayaReCharm3_EditPort.png)

- **Port Numbers:** Define the port numbers MayaReCharm will use to communicate with your Maya installations.<br>
    - When editing a port number, MayaReCharm displays the code required to open Maya for connections. You can execute
      this code in Maya or add it to your `userSetup.py` file.
- **Maya Stubs:** Python stubs library used for autocompletion. You can choose between:
    - `No stubs`: Infos fetched by the IDE from maya libs scan. Nearly no autocompletion.

## Usage

Once configured, `mayapy` interpreters are available as Python Interpreter. Select one of them through the bottom-right
interpreter selector in the IDE so you can enjoy proper syntax highlighting and code completion for Maya's Python API.
This also determines to which Maya instance `Execute Actions` will send the code.

![MayaReCharm_select_interpreter.jpg](docs/MayaReCharm_select_interpreter.png)

Maya interpreters can also be used in `Run Configurations`. The script will be executed by a new standalone `mayapy`
process.
In this specific case, `maya.cmds` will require an initialization as
explained [here](https://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2027/ENU/?guid=GUID-D457D6A0-1E7F-4ED2-B0B4-8B57153B563B)

![MayaReCharm Run Config](docs/MayaReCharm3_RunConfig.png)

### Actions

MayaReCharm provides two main actions in the `Run` menu, which can also be accessed via keyboard shortcuts:

- **Execute Document (`Alt+A`):** Sends the entire current file to Maya.
- **Execute Selection (`Alt+S`):** Sends only the selected code to Maya.

### Debugging

Debugging via Run Configurations is no longer supported due to reliability issues. However, you can use the standard
`Run | Attach to Process...` command. MayaReCharm ensures Maya instances are correctly identified in the
process list, allowing you to attach the local PyDev debugger.

![MayaReCharm Attach Dialog](docs/mc_attach_to_proc.png)

After attaching, **breakpoints** can be added to documents. They are supported when using both **Execute Selection** and
**Execute Document**.

### Logging

MayaReCharm provides a logging console that captures output from Maya. You can access it via
`View | Tool Windows | MayaLog` or by the Maya icon in the left tool window bar.

![MayaReCharm_logging.png](docs/MayaReCharm_logging.png)

The console supports one tab for each configured Maya interpreter, allowing you to view logs from multiple versions of
Maya simultaneously. It also supports search and log level filtering.

The ![MayaReCharm_Action.png](src/main/resources/icons/MayaReCharm_Action.png) button in the console toolbar is a
shortcut for the `Execute Document` action with a small twist. It will send the current file to the Maya
instance associated with the focused tab, even if the current project interpreter does not match.

The ![MayaReCharm_link16.png](src/main/resources/icons/MayaReCharm_link16.png)  button in the console toolbar is the new
location of the `Connect to Maya's log` action. It will try to connect to your Maya instance that matches the current
tab.
If the connection is successful, you'll see the message `PyCharm logger initialized and callback registered.` both in
the console (`INFO` level) and in the Maya script editor.
If nothing happens, try closing the tab and reopening it, or check the log level filter to ensure `INFO` level messages
are visible.
